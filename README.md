# Simulation of the process of carbon nanotubes system self-organization

This is the prototype of the application for my master thesis “Simulation of the process of carbon nanotubes system self-organization” that was written in Python. The main purpose was developing a numerical model for carbon nanotubes dynamics under an electric field.
